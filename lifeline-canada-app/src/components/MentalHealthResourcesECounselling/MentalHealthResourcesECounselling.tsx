                        The role of the counselor is to enable the client to explore many aspects of their life and feelings, by talking openly and freely. Talking in such a way it is rarely possible with family or friends, who are likely to be emotionally involved and have opinions and biases that may be detrimental to the success of the counseling.

                        It is important that the counselor is not emotionally involved with the client and does not become so during counselling sessions. The counsellor neither judges, nor offers advice. The counselor gives the client an opportunity to express difficult feelings such as anger, resentment, guilt and fear in a confidential environment.

                        The counsellor may encourage the client to examine parts of their lives that they may have found difficult or impossible to face before. There may be some exploration of early childhood experiences in order to throw some light on why an individual reacts or responds in certain ways in given situations. This is often followed by considering ways in which the client may change such behaviours. Effective counselling reduces confusion, allowing the client to make effective decisions leading to positive changes in their attitude and/or behaviour.
