                                <p className="mt-1 leading-relaxed">If you take prescription medications, it is important to make sure you take them as your doctor directed. Speak to your doctor if medications aren't working or if side effects are causing you problems. If you have just begun taking antidepressants, it is important to know that symptoms of depression resolve at different rates. Physical symptoms such as energy or sleep may improve first. Improvement in mood may be delayed. Speak to your doctor if you are feeling worse.</p>

                                <p className="mt-1 leading-relaxed">When you are feeling very low, do an activity you enjoy. You may find that very few things bring you pleasure.

Giving yourself a break from suicide thoughts can help, even if it's for a short time.</p>
