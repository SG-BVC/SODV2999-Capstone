          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            Suicide is a desperate attempt to escape suffering that has become
            unbearable. Blinded by feelings of self-loathing, hopelessness, and
            isolation, a suicidal person can’t see any way of finding relief
            except through death. But despite their desire for the pain to
            stop, most suicidal people are deeply conflicted about ending their
            own lives. They wish there was an alternative to suicide, but they
            just can’t see one.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="mt-6 bg-white/70 backdrop-blur-sm p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg border border-white/50 text-gray-700">
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            A suicidal person may not ask for help, but that doesn’t mean that help
            isn’t wanted. People who take their lives don’t want to die—they just
            want to stop hurting. Suicide prevention starts with recognizing the
            warning signs and taking them seriously. If you think a friend or family
            member is considering suicide, you might be afraid to bring up the
            subject. But talking openly about suicidal thoughts and feelings can
            save a life.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
            The World Health Organization estimates that approximately 1 million
            people die each year from suicide. What drives so many individuals to
            take their own lives? To those not in the grips of suicidal depression
            and despair, it’s difficult to understand what drives so many
            individuals to take their own lives. But a suicidal person is in so
            much pain that he or she can see no other option.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">Warning Signs of Suicide</h2>

          <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed">
            Take any suicidal talk or behavior seriously. It’s not just a warning
            sign that the person is thinking about suicide—it’s a cry for help.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed">
            Most suicidal individuals give warning signs or signals of their
            intentions. The best way to prevent suicide is to recognize these
            warning signs and know how to respond if you spot them. If you
            believe that a friend or family member is suicidal, you can play a
            role in suicide prevention by pointing out the alternatives, showing
            that you care, and getting a doctor or psychologist involved.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed">
            Major warning signs include talking about killing or harming oneself,
            talking or writing a lot about death or dying, and seeking out things
            that could be used in a suicide attempt, such as weapons and drugs.
            These signals are especially dangerous if the person has a mood
            disorder, suffers from alcohol dependence, has previously attempted
            suicide, or has a family history of suicide.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed">
            A more subtle but equally dangerous warning sign is hopelessness.
            People who feel hopeless may talk about “unbearable” feelings,
            predict a bleak future, and state that they have nothing to look
            forward to.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed">
            Other warning signs include dramatic mood swings or sudden changes
            in behaviour, loss of interest in daily activities, neglecting
            appearance, and big changes in eating or sleeping habits.

            Never agree to keep thoughts of suicide a secret. Sometimes instinct

          <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed">
            It’s better to have someone alive and mad at you than dead by suicide
            and you feeling that you missed an opportunity to help them keep
            safe. We recommend treating this subject and the people involved with
            respect, dignity and compassion and don’t keep it to yourself. Know

            Talking about suicide can provide tremendous relief and being a

            When experiencing intense emotions, the person will not be able to

          <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed">
            If you ever receive a phone call from someone who is suicidal, there
            are several things that you will want to do:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-3 space-y-2 text-base text-gray-700">
            <li>Listen attentively to everything that the caller says, and try to learn as much as possible about their problems.</li>
            <li>Allow the caller to cry, scream or swear. Suicidal feelings are very powerful, so let them come out.</li>
            <li>Stay calm, and be supportive, sympathetic, and kind.</li>
            <li>Do not be judgmental or invalidate the person’s feelings. Let the caller express emotions without negative feedback.</li>
            <li>After you understand the caller’s problems, summarize them back to the caller to avoid misunderstandings and show you are attentive.</li>
            <li>Then ask: “Are you feeling so bad that you are thinking about suicide?”</li>
            <li>If yes, ask: “Have you thought about how you would do it?”</li>
            <li>If yes, ask: “Do you have what you need to do it?”</li>
            <li>If yes, ask: “Have you thought about when you would do it?”</li>
          </ul>

          <div className="mt-4 bg-white/50 p-4 rounded-md border border-white/30">
            <h3 className="font-semibold">Abbreviated questions</h3>
            <p className="mt-2 text-base text-gray-800 font-medium">Suicidal? &nbsp; Method? &nbsp; Have what you need? &nbsp; When?</p>
          </div>

          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
            The reason for asking these questions is to assess the level of risk of
            suicide for the caller. If the caller answers yes to three or four
            questions, the risk is very high, and immediate treatment is necessary.
            Try to get the individual to call 911 or go to an emergency room.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed">
            If the caller answered yes to one or two questions, try to determine if
            immediate treatment is necessary. If you deem that it is, try to get
            the individual to call 911 or go to an emergency room.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed">
            At a minimum, try to get the individual to see a therapist and a medical
            doctor as soon as possible. Gently explain that they may have clinical
            depression or a similar condition that needs treatment.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed">
            Only let the person go when you are sure they are not in immediate
            danger of suicide. Before you let them go, emphasize that treatment is
            imperative — not optional.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">Handling a Call from a Suicidal Person</h2>

          <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed">By David L. Conroy, PhD.</p>

          <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed">
            Be yourself. The right words are unimportant. If you are concerned,
            your voice and manner will show it.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed">
            Listen. Let the person unload despair, ventilate anger. If given an
            opportunity to do this, he or she will feel better by the end of the
            call. No matter how negative the call seems, the fact that it exists
            is a positive sign, a cry for help.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed">
            Be sympathetic, non-judgmental, patient, calm, accepting. The caller
            has done the right thing by getting in touch with another person.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed">
            If the caller is saying "I'm so depressed, I can't go on," ask the
            question: "Are you having thoughts of suicide?" You are not putting
            ideas in their head; you are doing a good thing by showing concern and
            taking them seriously.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed">
            If the answer is yes, begin asking further questions: Have you
            thought about how you would do it (PLAN)? Have you got what you need
            (MEANS)? Have you thought about when you would do it (TIME SET)?
            Many callers will answer no at some point in this series or indicate
            that the time is set for the future.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed">
            Simply talking about their problems for a length of time will give
            suicidal people relief from loneliness and pent up feelings, an
            awareness that another person cares, and a feeling of being
            understood. These things take the edge off their agitated state and
            help them get through a bad night.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed">
            Avoid arguments, problem solving, advice giving, quick referrals,
            belittling and making the caller feel they have to justify their
            suicidal feelings. It is not how bad the problem is, but how badly it
            is hurting the person who has it.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed">
            If the person is ingesting drugs, get the details (what, how much,
            alcohol, other medications, last meal, general health) and call
            Poison Control. Ask for their address and phone number in case you
            need to follow up. If Poison Control recommends immediate medical
            assistance, try to arrange transport to an ER.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed">
            Do not go it alone. Get help during the call and debrief afterwards.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed">
            Your caller may be concerned about someone else who is suicidal. Just
            listen, reassure them that they are doing the right thing, and
            sympathize with their stressful situation. You can ask, "Have you
            ever been in a situation where you had thoughts of suicide?"
