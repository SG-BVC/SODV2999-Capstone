                Words of wisdom are helpful to anyone looking to get inspired through words
                that are as powerful as they are meaningful. They offer solace, clarity, and
                profound insights into the art of living. Sometimes a great mind can put a
                complex subject or feeling into a few succinct words to powerful effect.
              </p>
              <p>
                Motivational quotes provide us with a quick and timely burst of wisdom to get
                our focus back, offering the inspiration needed for the day or occasion. Often
                a quote can offer inspiration for the week, and inspire us when our normal
                motivation has lapsed.
