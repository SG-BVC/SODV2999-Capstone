                Stepping outside of oneself and focusing on the needs of others is
                an excellent Pattern Interrupt. Not only do you stop focusing on
                your own thoughts, but the reward of strengthening a friendship
                and the dopamine hit of working happily together with someone else
                all work together to make acting in kindness a very strong pattern
                interrupt and self help, well-being exercise.
              </p>

              <p>
                There is some evidence that being aware of our own acts of
                kindness, as well as the things we are grateful for, can increase
                feelings of happiness, optimism and satisfaction. Doing good may
                help you to have a more positive outlook about your own
                circumstances.
