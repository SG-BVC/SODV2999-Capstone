When we are able to be still, and be anchored in the now, we notice our thoughts more clearly. And when we become aware of our thoughts, we’re able to begin challenging them.',

                By cultivating mindfulness, we can learn to identify the negative
                thoughts that keep us trapped in feelings of self-doubt and shame,
                and learn instead to embrace the peacefulness that stems from
                living in the present moment.
              </p>

              <p>
                One of the easiest ways to be disconnected from our core selves is
                through habitual negative thinking. It can be easy to feel like
                negative or worrisome thoughts are capable of kidnapping our minds
                and taking us out of the present moment; especially when we’re
                stressed or anxious.
              </p>

              <p>
                These unpleasant thoughts are often based on automatic thought
                processes that have been playing over and over in our heads,
                unchallenged, for years. These thought patterns can fall into
                three general categories: labeling, catastrophizing, and
                overgeneralization.
